<h2>Objective</h2>

To predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using demographic and travel-related information.  
This project demonstrates skills in <b>data cleaning</b>, <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</b>, <b>visualization</b>, and <b>machine learning modeling</b>.

<h2>Process Overview</h2>

<b>1. Data Cleaning</b>  
- Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked).  
- Converted data types and standardized column formats.  

<b>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>  
- Visualized survival rates by class, age, and gender.  
- Explored relationships and correlations using heatmaps.  

<b>3. Model Building</b>  
- Trained a <b>Random Forest Classifier</b> to predict survival.  
- Evaluated model accuracy using a train-test split.  

<b>4. Insights</b>  
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had higher survival chances.  
- Women and children had better survival rates.  
- Age and fare were strong predictors of survival.

<h2>Model Performance</h2>

- **Accuracy:** ~85% (varies slightly per run)  
This indicates strong predictive power using a balanced dataset and well-selected features.

---

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

- Demonstrates a full data science workflow, from raw data to insights.  
- Shows understanding of data storytelling and model interpretability.  
- Forms a strong foundation for real-world applications such as customer purchase prediction or churn analysis.  

---

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

- Apply this same process to a business or e-commerce dataset.  
- Experiment with model tuning (e.g., <code>GridSearchCV</code>, <code>Gradient Boosting</code>).  
- Deploy on <b>Streamlit</b> or <b>Flask</b> for interactive visualization.
